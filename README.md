# Intro
These instructions are written for and have been tested on an M1 Mac against macOS Ventura 13.0.1.  

Your mileage may vary, but feedback is welcome.

# Setup
## Install Docker
Everything critical will execute inside a Docker container.

There are a variety of ways to install Docker, but one of the easiest for macOS is to use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io/).

> `brew cask install docker`
> 
> `open /Applications/Docker.app`

If you prefer, you may follow Docker's own directions to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
